# React Flow Project

This repository is a learning playground for exploring **React Flow** and building custom graph-based UI patterns.

The goal of this project is to:

- Understand how React Flow works internally
- Experiment with custom nodes, edges, and interactions
- Build small, focused experiments before converging on a concrete product idea

At this stage, the project is intentionally exploratory rather than feature-complete.
